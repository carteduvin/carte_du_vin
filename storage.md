### At the Best Cellar, the Service is the Difference
In 2008, Carte du Vin opened **The Best Cellar** wine storage in a space that was formerly Christie’s Fine Wine Auctions. Our goal was to have Los Angeles’ first, and only, full-service wine storage. Traditional wine storage lockers are labor intensive for collectors, and make it difficult to access the wine that you desire. Furthermore, keeping an accurate inventory, or efficiently using the locker space, is nearly impossible.
At The Best Cellar, we perform a complete inventory of your collection, and manage the entire process of accessing your wines from storage. Your collection will be viewable on [Cellartracker.com](http://www.cellartracker.com/), which comes complete with wine reviews, scores, current valuation, and drink-by dates. Our palletized, warehouse-style storage, allows us to keep rates competitive by only charging on the space that you use. Our location has multi-layered security, and is temperature and humidity controlled.  

The Best Cellar offers a complete selection of services including inventory management, receiving of packages or pallets, shipping nationwide, local delivery, moving locally or nationally, short-term storage, and wine storage strategies. Please contact us for current rates.
